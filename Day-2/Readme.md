🔐 What is IAM in AWS?
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.
It is a free service provided by AWS that helps you securely control access to your AWS resources.

🧠 In Simple Words:
IAM is like the security guard of your AWS account.
It decides who can log in and what they can do.

✅ Why IAM is Important?
It helps you control who can access your AWS services (like EC2, S3, RDS, etc.).

Prevents unauthorized access and accidental damage to your resources.

Essential for keeping your AWS environment safe and organized.

 IAM Helps With:
✅ Login and authentication

✅ Fine-grained permission control

✅ Enforcing least privilege

✅ Setting up multi-factor authentication (MFA)

✅ Auditing access with CloudTrail
